# Purpose
This site was made for uOttawa's SEG 3125 course. Although this is a school project, I decided to make a website for a real company.

Steampunk Education is a STEM education company that I co-founded with my brother; after 4 years of running the company, we have taught over 1000 students across Ontario and Québec.
