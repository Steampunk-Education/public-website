# Purpose
Steampunk Education is a STEM education company that I co-founded with my brother; after 5 years of running the company, we have taught over 1000 students across Ontario and Qu√©bec.
Steampunk offers hands-on workshops that teach students how to build robots, VR games, and custom AI agents. Steampunk is active partners with [The Peel District School Board](https://www.peelschools.org/), (Glebe Collegiate Institude)[https://glebe.ocdsb.ca/] and [The Mississippi Mills Public Library](https://www.missmillslibrary.com/) among many others.
